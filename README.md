# Punk Font 01

## Description

A grotesk font with a punk attitude, no expectations and CAPS ONLY.

Font Forge was used to create the font.

In the 'characters-reference' folder letters created in Illustrator can be found. These were exported and used in Font Forge to compile the font. 

A lot of things are missing:
- Numbers
- A lot of special characters
- Kernings need to be adjusted

At the actual state, it's advised to use it just for simple text displays.
